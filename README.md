## How To Use

- ### Home

  In the *Home* page user can see all entry titles.

  - When user clicks on:

    - `Entry title`: he will be taken directly to that entry page.

    - `Home`: wherever the user is, he will get redirected to the *Home* page.

    - `Create new page`: he will go to page where he need to implement a *title* that it's not used, and enter the Markdown content, and click `Save` after.

    - `Random page`: he will get redirected to a random encyclopedia page.

- ### Searching
    The search is very simple and user friendly, if the query **exactly** matches the name of any encyclopedia, the user will get redirected to that encyclopedia page, if not, the user should instead be taken to a search results page that displays a list of all encyclopedia that have the query as part of its title.
    
    -  For example: \
      If the query was **py**, **Python** entry will appear.
